# async-python-things

## Stop
This project **was** a playground for working with async python / bocadillo, with a vue js frontend and websockets.  Also it was a chance to try out pipenv.

- async / bocadillo = nice, but breaking changes between 0.13 and 0.14
- vuejs, enjoy working on this but mixing backend and frontend in one project like this is a bit messy
- pipenv, nice idea, but poor execution, hopefully it improves.

This projet is abandoned.
