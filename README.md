## How to use backend
=======
>>>>>>> b9f425a686ef2f6df6a06253bb308fd134380b01

## Setup
1. Ensure you have pipenv installed, through your package manager or via `pip install pipenv`
1. Create virtual environment and install dependencies with `pipenv install`
1. Also run `pipenv run pip install chatterbot` * 

* pipenv when it installs chatterbot-corpus doesn't pull in chatterbot as it would have a conflicting version of pyyaml, this is hacky but it works until chatterbot-corpus upgrades to a newer pyyaml

## Usage
1. Get a shell in the virtual environment with `pipenv shell`
1. Run the server with `pipenv run python app.py`
1. Run the client with `pipenv run python client.py`

## Frontend / Vuejs

Project setup `npm install`
Compiles and hot-reloads for development `npm run serve`
Compiles and minifies for production `npm run build`
Run your tests `npm run test`
Lints and fixes files `npm run lint`

## TODO list in no particular order

- train Diego to understand more things
- add more endpoints to the API
- create a working docker image
